# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling on the classic Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on various features such as age, sex, class, and more.

## Repository Contents

* `Titanic_dataset.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data loading, cleaning, visualization, and modeling steps.

## Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visual insights into the distribution of features and their relationship with survival outcomes.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) with evaluation metrics.
* **Visualization:** Graphical representation of survival rates and feature importance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-dataset-analysis.git
   cd titanic-dataset-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**

   Open `Titanic_dataset.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Ensure the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files are in the working directory before running the notebook.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The notebook concludes with model evaluations and highlights the best-performing model based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.
